Routinely is a calendar application that provides recommended schedules that adhere to COVID-19 safety measures, while incentivizing children to stick to a routine.

A routine helps provide structure, increases efficiency, and helps reduce stress. For families of all shapes and sizes, routine is the cornerstore of a healthy lifestyle.

From our homepage we can toggle between your personal calendar, the calendars of our family unit, activities, and a discover page.
On the community tab, you can view a feed that provides fun reminders and updates from calendars you’re connected with
On the Activities tab you can browse through items that can be easily added to your calendar and include everything from meal plan options to physical activities… even ways to focus on our mental health during the pandemic. 
On the Discover page users will be provided with up-to-date COVID-19 information directly from trusted and reliable sources.

Routinely makes it simple to access publicly available resources and content so that families aren’t left scouring the internet for activities that fit their unique schedules and preferences.
